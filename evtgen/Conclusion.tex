Studies of heavy flavor production fractions, fragmentation functions and decay properties 
for four MC generators are presented.
Bottom production fractions vary among generators, largely due to large differences
of up to 6.5\%\ in the baryon fraction.  For charm production, 
the generators overestimate the $D^+$ fraction.  The $D^0$ fraction
in \Herwig\ is significantly lower than for the other three generators; \Herwig, \Pythia, and
\PythiaE\ are in good agreement with world average data.
Distributions of $x$ ($x_p$), the fraction of the heavy quark energy (momentum) carried by
the bottom (charm) hadron have been studied using $e^+e^-$ samples generated
with the same showering parameters used in modern LHC tunes.  Differences in the mean value of $x$  
generated differ by up to 5\%\ for bottom and up to 12\%\ for charm.  Studies of $f(z)$,
the fraction of the jet momentum carried by the heavy flavor hadron, from \ttbar\ samples
show good agreement among all the generators except for \Herwigpp, which has a
mean value of $z$ for bottom jets s higher by about 2\%.  Comparisons of $f(z)$ distributions for
high transverse momentum jets indicate that the treatment of heavy flavor pair production
differs between among the generators.
\EvtGen\ was found to improve agreement with PDG values for the decays of heavy flavor particles, but modifications to the standard \EvtGen\ inclusive decay table further improve agreement with the experimental measurements of branching fractions.
