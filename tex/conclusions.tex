The extra jets produced in association with top quark pairs in $e\mu$ events with at least 2 \bjet s from 2012 data collected with the ATLAS detector have been fully corrected back to particle-level. Among next-to-leading order generators, 
\hdamp\ provides the best description of the data while
\powpy\, \peight\ and \pow+\hw\ are slightly disfavored. Comparisons with generators show that \mcnlohw produces extra jets in poor agreement with those in data. Among leading-order multi-leg generators,  \madgraph\ and \alpg\ interfaced with \py\ agree reasonably well with data,  while \alpg+\hw\ does not. Comparing data to leading-order generators with scale variations shows  that \madgraph\ and \alpg\ interfaced with \py\ reprodduce data with a lower scale parameter. Both scale variations of \acermc\ interfaced with \py\ do not agree with data.
