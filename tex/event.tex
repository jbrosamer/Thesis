The following section describes the procedure used to select the events used for analysis. First, the data and simulation samples to be used are defined. Then, the fiducial definition of the physics objects used to select the events is given. Then, the criteria for selecting events is discussed. Finally, the event yields and reconstructed distributions are reviewed. 

\section{Data samples}
\subsection{Collision data}
The analysis is performed on the complete 2012 $pp$  \rts=8 \tev\ LHC collision dataset. Events are required to
fulfill standard data quality requirements that ensure that all detector components are functioning. Events are required to pass a single electron or single muon trigger chain, with thresholds that are maximally efficient for leptons passing offline selections of $p_T>25$\,GeV. % For electrons, the OR of the \texttt{ EF\_24vh\_medium1}\ and \texttt{ EF\_e60\_medium1}\ trigger chains is used. For muons, the OR of \texttt{ EF\_mu24i\_tight}\ and \texttt{ EF\_mu36\_tight} is used. In each case, the higher threshold trigger has no isolation requirement, and adds to the acceptance of the lower threshold trigger at higher lepton $p_T$. 

Events are selected from both \texttt{ Egamma} and \texttt{ Muons} data streams defined by the trigger chains. To avoid double counting of $e\mu$ events appearing in both streams, events passing electron triggers are only accepted from the \texttt{Egamma} stream, {\em i.e.} the \texttt{ Muons} stream is only used for events selected \emph{only} by muon triggers. 
After all these selections, the final analyzed data samples correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3\,\ifb\ with an uncertainty of 2.8\%.
\subsection{Simulated Samples}

Simulated Monte Carlo event samples are used in this analysis to evaluate the efficiency and uncertainty of signal and background.  Both uncorrected and corrected data distributions are also compared to simulated samples to distiguish between physics models. .% The corresponding dataset (DS) identification numbers are given  in Tables~\ref{t:ttsamples},~\ref{t:bgsamples}, and ~\ref{t:wtsamples} and a complete list of dataset names is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:ds}.

Samples are processed either through the full ATLAS Geant4\cite{bib:g4} based detector simulation (``FS'') or through the \texttt{ AtlFast2}\cite{atlfast2} fast simulation. All samples include additional overlaid minimum bias events generated with \textsc{  Pythia8} \cite{pythia8} to simulate pileup background. 
The simulated samples are reweighted to reproduce the same distributions of $\mu$, the average number of interactions per bunch crossing, as the data. The samples are also reweighted with scale factors to reproduce the electron and muon reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, and the width of the primary vertex distribution in $z$, as measured in the data. Finally, scale factors are applied to account for $b$-tagging efficiencies. 

\subsubsection{\ttbar samples}\label{ss:mcsignal}

Several different \ttbar\ generators are compared to data. The baseline \ttbar\ samples are produced using \textsc{  Powheg} \cite{Powheg, Powheg2, Powheg3, Powheg4} interfaced to \textsc{  Pythia6} \cite{pythia6} with the Perugia 2011C tune \cite{perugia}, CT10 parton density functions (PDFs) \cite{cttenpdf}, the hdamp parameter set to $\infty$ and fast simulation.  
This same MC tune has been processed using full simulation and the results of the two samples have been compared.
%After appropriate
%JES corrections are applied, systematic differences in the prediction are observed. 
%The stress test in Chapter~\ref{sec:unfold} confirms the agreement of these two samples.
The atlfast2 sample with the hdamp parameter set to $\infty$ is chosen as the baseline because it has signifigantly higher statistics ($\sim 40$ times data) than either the FS or hdamp=$m_t$ samples ($\sim 20$ times data).
Systematic uncertainties associated with the difference in the response matrices obtained from FS and atlfast are
assessed in Chapter~\ref{ch:syst}.


%For the baseline dataset, samples using both full and fast  simulation are analyzed to confirm that after making appropriate JES corrections, there are no differences in the predictions.

Alternative \ttbar\ simulation samples are also studied.  At next-to-leading-order, these include \textsc{  Powheg} plus \textsc{  Pythia6}  with the hdamp parameter set to $m_{t}$; \textsc{  Powheg} plus \textsc{  Pythia8} with the hdamp parameter set to $m_{t}$ and the A14 tune ; \textsc{  MC@NLO} \cite{mcatnlo, mcatnlo2} interfaced to \textsc{  Herwig} \cite{Herwig, Herwig1, Herwig2} with \textsc{  Jimmy} \cite{jimmy} for the underlying event modeling and with the ATLAS AUET2 \cite{auet} tune and CT10 PDFs; and \textsc{  Powheg} plus \textsc{  Herwig}. 
Alternate multi-leg leading order samples include \textsc{  MadGraph} \cite{Alwall:2011uj} interfaced to \textsc{  Pythia6} \cite{pythia6} with the Perugia 2011C tune \cite{perugia}, and CT10 parton density functions (PDFs) \cite{cttenpdf}; \textsc{  Alpgen} \cite{alpgen} interfaced to \textsc{  Herwig} and \textsc{  Jimmy}, with
the CTEQ6L1 PDFs \cite{CTEQ}; and \textsc{  Alpgen} interfaced to \textsc{  Pythia6}
. To study the effects of initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR), several samples with different radition parameters were used.

%ADD IN HERWIG FOR PARTON SHOWERING+MADGRAPH Q2+ISR FSR

The \textsc{ Powheg} and \textsc{ MC@NLO} samples include all \ttbar\ final states except fully-hadronic, where both $W$ bosons decay to \qqbar\ giving a negligible probability to pass the event selection. The \textsc{  MadGraph} sample only included dileptonic final states, where both $W$ bosons decay to leptons. Most of these MC samples contain more than ten times the data statistics.

\subsubsection{Single top samples}
Only the $Wt$ channel of single top production contributes significantly to \emubb\ events. Single top production is modeled using \textsc{  Powheg+Pythia} with the CT10 PDFs and the Perugia P2011C tune, using the `diagram removal' \cite{Frixione:2008yi} generation scheme. Alternative physics models include the \textsc{  Powheg+Pythia} sample with `diagram subtraction' \cite{Frixione:2008yi} and \mcnlohw.

\subsubsection{Background samples}\label{ss:mcbkg}

$Z$+jets events with $Z\rightarrow \ell^-\ell^+$ and diboson production ($WW$, $WZ$ and~$ZZ$) where both bosons decay leptonically can contribute to background. $Z$+jets background is modeled using \textsc{  Alpgen} \cite{Mangano:2002ea} with CTEQ6L1 PDFs, interfaced to \textsc{  Pythia6} with the Perugia P2011C tune, including both samples with 0--5 additional light partons, 
\ccbar\ plus an additional 0--3 partons, and \bbbar\
plus 0--3 partons. The heavy flavor overlap procedure (HFOR) \cite{hfor} is used to avoid double counting of configurations where the \ccbar\ or \bbbar\ pair could be produced from either the matrix element or parton shower. The simulated $Z+$jets  events are scaled by the ratios of $Z\rarrow ee$+2 $b$-jets or $Z\rarrow \mu\mu$+2 $b$-jets measured in simulation and data, to account for the mismodeling of heavy-flavor jets produced with $Z$ bosons. Ref.~\cite{xsec} computes this scale factor to be $1.13 \pm 0.08$. 

Diboson production is simulated using \textsc{  Alpgen+Herwig} with up to three additional partons.

\subsection{Pileup jet samples}
Modeling of pileup collisions (see Chapter~\ref{ch:atlas}) is studied both using the default \powpy\ generator as well as a data driven estimate. The data driven \emph{overlay} sample takes pileup events from data and combines them with \ttbar\ events from \powpy\. The difference between these two estimates is taken as a systematic uncertainty.
\section{Object definitions}
The object and event selection used in this thesis follows the generic ATLAS recommendations for 2012, with two exceptions.  The first change is a loosening of the electron isolation criteria, which is possible due to the low background  $e\mu$ final state. This loosened requirement is also used in Ref.~\cite{xsec}. The second change is to relax the $\eta$ requirement on  jets to $|\eta|<4.5$.

\subsection{Reconstructed objects}\label{s:objects}

The analysis relies on the selection of electrons, muons and jets, and
the tagging of jets as $b$-jets.
\begin{description}
\item[Muons:] Combined muons (reconstructed in both the muon spectrometer
and inner detector) are required to satisfy $p_T>25$\,GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$.  Muons must have
\begin{itemize}
\item at least one pixel hit
\item at least 5 SCT hits
\item fewer than 3 holes in pixel and SCT layers combined
\item In the region $0.1 < |\eta| < 1.9 $: $n_{TRT Hits} + n_{TRT Outliers} > 5$ and $\frac{n_{TRT Hits}}{n_{TRT Hits} + n_{TRT Outliers}} < 0.9$, where an outliter is a TRT straw with a signal but not crossed by the nearby track.
\end{itemize}

The impact parameter
in the longitudinal direction with respect to the primary vertex is
required to satisfy $z_0<2$\,mm.  To reduce the background from
muons from heavy flavor decays inside jets, muons are required to be
separated by $\Delta R>0.4$ from the nearest jet. Muons are required to satisfy 
mini-isolation requirement $I^\ell_{\textrm mini}<0.05$, where
the mini-isolation variable is the ratio of the sum of $p_T$ of tracks
in a variable-sized cone of radius $\Delta R=10\,{\textrm GeV}/p_T(\mu)$ to the $p_T$ of the muon $p_T(\mu)$ \cite{topreco}. %For anti-muons, the mini-isolation requirement is energy loss of less than 6 GeV, $\texttt{ ETCone20}/p_{T} < 0.03$, and $I^\ell_{\textrm mini}<0.1$

\item[Electrons:] Electrons are selected using the offline \texttt{ tight++} 
identification within the fiducial region $p_T>25$\,GeV and $|\eta|<2.47$, 
excluding the calorimeter transition region $1.37<|\eta|<1.52$. The impact parameter
in the longitudinal direction with respect to the primary vertex is
required to satisfy $z_0<2$\,mm. In addition 
to the calorimeter isolation requirements implicit in \texttt{ tight++},
the calorimeter energy in a cone of radius $\Delta R<0.2$ around the
electron (excluding the deposit from the electron itself) is required
to be less than $6$\,GeV, and the sum of $p_T$ of tracks
in a cone of radius $\Delta R<0.3$ (excluding the electron track) is
required to be less than 6 \GeV. Further
kinematic-dependent cuts are applied to these two isolation variables,
corresponding to a 98\,\% efficiency on true prompt electrons. 
\item[Overlap removal:]
To prevent double-counting
of electron energy deposits as jets, jets within $\Delta R<0.2$ of 
a reconstructed electron are removed. If the nearest jet surviving
the above cut is within $\Delta R<0.4$ of the electron, the electron
is discarded, to ensure it is cleanly separated from nearby jet activity. Electrons sharing a track with a muon are excluded by removing electrons with a muon within $\Delta \phi < 0.005$ and $\Delta \theta < 0.005$.

\item[Jets:] Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm 
\cite{antikt1,antikt2,antikt3} with radius parameter $R=0.4$, 
starting from topological clusters. These are calibrated
using the local cluster weighting (LCW) method, and corrected for the
effects of pileup using the jet area method and a residual correction dependent
on the instantaneous luminosity and number of reconstructed primary vertices 
in the event. Jets are calibrated using an energy- and $\eta$-dependent simulation-based calibration scheme, with in-situ corrections 
based on data \cite{jesxi}. Jets are accepted within the fiducial region $p_T>25$\,GeV and $|\eta|<4.5$. To reduce the contribution from jets 
associated with pileup jets with $p_T<50$\,GeV
are required to satisfy $|\textrm{JVF}|>0.5$, where $\textrm{JVF}$ is
the ratio of the sum of the $p_T$ of tracks associated to the jet which
are also associated to the primary vertex, to the sum of $p_T$ of all
tracks associated to the jet. Jets with no associated tracks or with
$|\eta|>2.4$ at the edge of the tracker acceptance  are assigned
$\textrm{JVF}=-1$ by convention and thus always accepted.
Reconstructed jets 
within $\Delta R<0.2$ of a selected electron are removed.

\item[$b$-tagging:] Jets within the central region ($|\eta| < 2.5$) are $b$-tagged using the MV1 algorithm 
\cite{btagcom,btagptrel}, which outputs a multivariate discriminant $w$ with values between zero and one. 
Light-quark and gluon jets tend to have values close to zero, and 
$b$-flavored jets close to one, with charm jets somewhere in between. Jets are defined as being $b$-tagged if the MV1 weight $w$ is larger than a cut value 0.7892, which corresponds to the $b$-tagging working 
point having approximately 70\% $b$-tagging efficiency for $b$-jets in \ttbar\ events, although the exact efficiency varies significantly with $p_T$. The $b$-tagging calibration used is the default in \texttt{ TopRootCore}, which is based on the system8 muon and jet calibration method~\cite{btagsys8}.
\end{description}
Events reconstructed with exactly one $e$ and $\mu$ with opposite sign and at least 2-$b$ jets as defined above pass the reconstruction-level fiducial selection. In the case of Monte Carlo, selected events are reweighted to reproduce the same distributions of $\mu$, the average number of interactions per bunch crossing, as in the data. The samples are also reweighted with scale factors to reproduce the electron and muon reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, and the width of the primary vertex distribution in $z$, as measured in the data. Finally, scale factors are applied to account for $b$-tagging efficiencies.
\subsection{Truth objects}
In addition to fiducial definitions for reconstructed from detector output, fiducial definitions for the ``true'' particles generated by the MC simulation must be made. The cuts applied to truth objects attempt to replicate the above fiducial selections for the reconstructed objects as closely as possible.

\begin{description}
\item[Leptons:] Stable electrons and muons are required not to come from a hadron in the Monte Carlo truth particle record, either directly or through a tau decay. This ensures that the lepton is from an electroweak decay without requiring a direct $W$-boson match. The four momenta of the bare leptons are then `dressed' by adding the four momenta of all stable photons within $\Delta R$=0.1 with status code 1 and not originating from Geant4. The dressed leptons are required to have \pt $>$ 25 \GeV\ and $|\eta|$ $<$ 2.5.
\item[Jets:] Truth jets are clustered using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm  with radius parameter $R=0.4$, starting from all stable particles, except for selected leptons ($e$, $\mu$, $\nu$) and the photons used to dress the leptons. Truth jets are required to have \pT $>$ 10 \GeV, $|\eta| <$ 4.5. Though only jets with \pT $>$ 25 \GeV\ are considered in the final result, lowering the \pt\ requirement for truth jets allows matching across the fiducial boundary. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:extrajets}.

\item[$b$-tagging:] $B$ hadrons with \pT $>$ 5 \GeV\ are associated with jets through ghost matching~\cite{ghostmatch}. Truth $b$-tagged jets have \pT $>$ 25 \GeV, $|\eta|$ $<$ 2.5 and at least one ghost associated $B$-hadron with $p^{{\textrm B}}_{T} > 5$ \GeV.

\item[Overlap removal:] Truth objects are subject to the same overlap removal criteria as reconstructed objects, after dressing and jet reclustering. The closest jet within $\Delta R$ $<$ 0.2 of an electron is excluded from consideration.  After such jets are removed, 
muons  and electrons with $\Delta R$ $<$ 0.4 of a jet are excluded. Electrons overlapping with muons are removed if $\Delta \phi_{e\mu} < 0.005$ and $\Delta \theta_{e\mu} < 0.005$.
\end{description}


Events with exactly one $e$ and $\mu$ with opposite sign and at least 2-$b$ jets as defined above pass the fiducial truth selection.

\subsection{Truth matching}

\label{ss:tmatching}
In order to correct reconstructed objects back to truth level, a prescription must be adopted to match reconstructed and truth objects. A geometric $\Delta R$ algorithm matches reconstructed objects to truth objects satisfying the fiducial requirements above. These definitions are relevant for background unmatched extra jets, as well as various truth studies.
\begin{description}
\item[Leptons:] Each truth $e$ ($\mu$) is matched to the closest reconstructed $e$ ($\mu$) within $\Delta R < 0.02$.
\item[Jets:] Truth jets are geometrically matched to the closest reconstructed jet within $\Delta R_{\mathrm{reco jet, truth jet}} < 0.4$. If a reconstructed jet is not matched to a truth jet, it is assumed to be either from pileup or matching inefficiency and is treated as background as discussed in Chapter~\ref{ss:pileup}.

In selecting $e\mu$+2 $b$-jet events, $b$-jets are matched to truth jets before extra jets are matched to truth jets. Thus, if both an extra jet and a $b$-jet satisfy $\Delta R_{\mathrm{reco jet, truth jet}}<0.4$, the $b$-jet is matched to the truth jet and the extra jet is unmatched. If two $b$-jets or two extra jets are reconstructed within $\Delta R_{\mathrm{reco jet, truth jet}}<0.4$ of a single truth jet, the reconstructed jet with smaller $\Delta R_{\mathrm{reco jet, truth jet}}$ is matched to the truth jet and the other reconstructed jet is unmatched.

Because of limited \pt\ resolution, the reconstructed \pt\ of a jet can vary significantly from its truth \pt. The \pt\ threshold for truth jets is lowered to 10 \GeV, so that jets reconstructed with $\pt > 25 \GeV$ can match truth jets that fail the fiducial \pt\ cut. 



\item[Parton matching:] For some studies, the truth jets from top are identified via a parton matching procedure. Each jet is matched to the highest energy parton\footnote{Quarks (u,d,s,c,b), gluons, photons and pdgId = 0 particles.} with \pt $>$ 5 \GeV\ within $\Delta R = 0.4$. If this parton is a decay product of the top, then the jet is considered a `top jet.'
\end{description}
\section{Event selection}
The process of selecting \emubb\ events proceeds as follows. First, events are selected from simulation and data by vetoing a small number of events failing cleaning cuts defined below. Then events are required to have exactly one electron and one muon with opposite charges. Finally, events with at least two $b$-tagged jets are selected. In events with more than two $b$-tagged jets, the two $b$-jets with the highest MV1 are considered the $b$-jets used to select the event and the remaining $b$-jet(s) are considered extra jets. The selection requirements are identical to those in the 2012 \ttbar cross-section analysis~\cite{xsec}, with the exception of requiring \textit{at least} two $b$-tagged jets instead of \textit{exactly} two.

\subsection{Cleaning cuts}

Events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex with at least five associated tracks. Events containing any jets with $p_T>20\GeV$ and positive energy that fail the `Bad Loose Minus' (also known as  `Looser') jet quality cuts \cite{jetcleaning} are removed (`jet cleaning'). To remove events containing cosmic rays, events with two muons passing the muon selection requirements given above, each having an impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex $d_0>0.5$\,mm and separated in azimuthal angle $\phi$ by $\Delta\phi>3.1$\,rad, are vetoed.

A muon undergoing catastrophic bremsstrahlung/energy loss in the calorimeter
can leave a large energy deposit, causing it to be reconstructed as both
an electron and a muon, and potentially giving rise to a fake $e\mu$ event.  Such background is reduced by vetoing $e\mu$ events if the electron and muon are separated by $\Delta\phi<0.005$ and $\Delta\theta<0.005$, where $\phi$ and $\theta$ are the azimuthal and polar angles of the selected leptons
(muon bremsstrahlung cut).

\subsection{Event yields}

The numbers of events with exactly one $e$ and one $\mu$ before and after the $b$-jet requirement are given in Table~\ref{t:sel}. Simulation predictions are categorized into contributions from \ttbar, $Wt$ single top, $Z$+jets and dibosons. 

After the selection of $e\mu$ opposite-sign pairs, the biggest contribution (60\%) is from \ttbar events with the second largest from $Z$+jets (21.8\%). The $e\mu$ event rates agree to  better than 3\% with those from other ongoing 2012 top analyses as documented in \texttt{ TopEventChallenge}\cite{topeventchallenge}. The events with at least 2 $b$-jets are heavily dominated by \ttbar events, with a small $\sim 3\%$ contribution from single top. $Z$+jets and dibosons make up less than 0.1\% of events passing the final selection, and are thus neglected in this analysis.


The number of selected events in simulation and data agree to within better than 3\%, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo reproduces the data quite well. Table~\ref{t:ttgen} compares the number of selected events from the baseline \ttbar simulation to those from other \ttbar generators. The two \pow+\py\ simulations and \mcnlohw\ all agree with each other to within ~2\%. The \madpy\ simulation gives about 10\% more events. The last column in Table~\ref{t:ttgen} gives the scale factor used to normalize each \ttbar generator to the number of events in data (including the single top contribution).

%To facilitate comparison with Ref.~\cite{xsecnote}, Table~\ref{t:exact2sel} gives the number of \ttbar simulation and data events with exactly 2 $b$-jets. Removing events with more than 2 $b$-jets reduces the number of events by ~2\% in both simulation and data. The event counts given in Table 4.2 of Ref.~\cite{xsecnote} are not directly comparable because they exclude contributions from misidentified leptons and correspond to a greater luminosity of 20.3\ifb. Adding back in the misidentified lepton contribution and then scaling by $20.1/20.3=0.989$ gives an `adjusted' event count in the final column. This analysis finds 2.1\% more events in data and 0.3\% more events in simulation than Ref.~\cite{xsecnote}. These differences are likely due to the new calibrations used in this analysis.


\subsection{Reconstructed distributions}
In Figures~\ref{fig:emu} and ~\ref{fig:bjet}, the properties of reconstructed lepton and $b$-jets in $e\mu$+2 $b$-jet events are compared in simulation and data. The negligible contributions from $Z$+jets and dibosons are not shown. Simulation is normalized to the number of events in data using the scale factors in Table~\ref{t:ttgen} in order to study the shape differences and remove uncertainties from the \ttbar cross section. In Figures~\ref{fig:emu} and ~\ref{fig:bjet}, the statistical uncertainity on the data is shown as a gray band on the ratio plot and statistical uncertainties on the simulation are shown as error bars on the ratio. Systematic uncertainities are not shown.

Figure~\ref{fig:emu} shows the \pt\ and $\eta$ distributions of the leptons. 
%The modeled \pt spectra are slightly softer than those in data. 
%The baseline \pow+\py hdamp=$\infty$ best reproduces the lepton $\eta$ observed in data. 
Figure~\ref{fig:bjet} shows the \pt\ and $\eta$ distributions of the 2 $b$-jets used to select the events. 
%\hdamp and \powpy\ agree best with the $b$-jet \pt in data, while the other three generators have slightly softer distributions. The $b$-jet $\eta$ is modeled well by all simulations.

Overall, the $b$-jets and the leptons are well modeled by simulation. \pow+\py\ hdamp=$\infty$ agrees  well, motivating its suitability as a baseline simulation.\footnote{The baseline sample is primarily chosen for high statistics} These observations are consistent with those in Ref.~\cite{xsecnote}.
